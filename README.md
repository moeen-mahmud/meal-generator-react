## My Process

### Built With

- React JS
- JavaScript
- API
- CSS3
- HTML5
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles

### What I learned

By doing this project, I learned how to create custom hook and components. I use the `useState` to determine the state and keep a function for the button as the event listener. I demonstrated the code below:

```js
const Meal = () => {
  const [meal, setMeal] = useState([]);

  const handleClick = () => {
    fetch("https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setMeal(data.meals[0]));
  };

  return (
    <div className="meal">
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</button>
      <Suggested meal={meal}></Suggested>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Continued Development

- This is my second React based project. From now on, I will try to build projects with React.

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired from [Florin Pop's 100days100project Challenge](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/random-meal-generator). Although, he did the project using Vanilla JS. However, I try to do this using React.
